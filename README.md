# Chessclock

This is a simple a app to play chess with your friend over the board. It is hosted at https://chessclock.net. Feel free
to check it out. :smiley:

The timecontrols are configurable in the settings.

The app is meant to be used on mobile and can be installed as a PWA for an even better experience. You can trigger the
timer with spacebar, if you want to play on Desktop tough.

To run this app you will need angular version 10+.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change
any of the source files. Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/`
directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
